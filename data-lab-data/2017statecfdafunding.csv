VA,97.024,Emergency Food and Shelter National Board Program,B - Project Grants,"Program funds support the National Preparedness Goal (NPG) by complementing actions undertaken to achieve an all-of-Nation preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources. When a disaster strikes, it is often the poor or those with economic vulnerabilities who suffer the most. By providing emergency economic assistance that keeps people off the streets, from being evicted from their homes, or with groceries to prevent hunger, the EFSP prepares a population that could otherwise be even more adversely impacted by a disaster situation and mitigates potential burdens imposed on recovery efforts to assist such people. For additional details on the NPG, please refer to http://www.fema.gov/pdf/prepared/npg.pdf.","The law directs that the Local Boards, which manage the program at the local level, shall determine which private nonprofit organizations or public organizations of the local government in the individual locality shall receive grants to act as service providers. The range of participant groups on the Local Boards include the affiliates of the National Board membership which consists of American Red Cross, Catholic Charities USA, The Jewish Federations of North America, National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, The Salvation Army, and United Way Worldwide, with a local government representative replacing FEMA. Also participating are thousands of independent nonprofits (such as Community Action Agencies and Food Banks and food pantries) which provide food and/or shelter services. Due to the broad category of people in need of such emergency services, the providers can include specialized groups such as domestic violence shelters, Native American organizations, and organizations providing food or shelter to: AIDS patients, handicapped individuals, the elderly, homeless veterans, non-wards of the State teenage runaways, and many other groups with emergency food and shelter needs. As noted earlier, the decisions on selections are made through the consensus of the Local Board as they have assessed their communitys most urgent needs. It is important that such agencies use these funds to supplement, not replace, their current efforts. This program is intended to supplement ongoing programs and allow them to extend and expand upon their existing services.",State,2,Support Services,http://www.fema.gov,https://cfda.gov/index?s=program&mode=form&tab=step1&id=25e8c0bc8d5b568e2f5f0f3b1cf0aca6,1.20E+08
